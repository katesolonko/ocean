A simple simulation of how bicomponent system can have features of selforganization.
Like in James Lovelock`s "Daisyworld" model it shows the populations` cycling.

What happens here:
  "prey" can eat, grow, produce children and die;
	"predator" - eats the "prey", and does pretty much the same as the "prey".

It can be extended by adding another actions and attendees :)
